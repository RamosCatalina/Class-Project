# Class Project: Creating an app

#  Objective 

The team's goal was to develop a basic app with geography information of all countries that can be used in schools to teach kids the most important geographical facts 
about each country. For example, the app will show the Top 10 geographical features (i.e., mountains, rivers, lakes, canyons, forests) of the selected geographical region.

The data source was the Wikipedia site. The procurement process is the following:

1. The Wikipedia python library connects with the Wikipedia website through their API, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
2. It returns the URL for the selected country and geographical feature
3. It scrapes the selected URL and returns a JSON file
4. The JSON file is saved in the MongoDB
5. The development of the app executed using Flask
